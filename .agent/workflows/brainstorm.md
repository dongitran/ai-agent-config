# Brainstorm Workflow

// turbo-all

## Overview

| Phase | Name | Goal | Time |
|-------|------|------|------|
| 0 | **Warm-up** | Activate creative thinking | 3-5 min |
| 1 | **Clarify** | Define problem deeply | 10-15 min |
| 2 | **Ideate** | Generate many ideas (diverge) | 20-30 min |
| 3 | **Evaluate** | Analyze and prioritize (converge) | 15-20 min |
| 4 | **Visualize** | Diagram solution | 10-15 min |
| 5 | **Decide** | Document decision & next steps | 10-15 min |

---

## Phase 0: Warm-up

Prime your brain before diving in. Choose 1-2 exercises (60 sec each):

- **Random Word**: Pick random word → force 3 connections to your problem
- **Opposite Day**: What if we did the COMPLETE OPPOSITE?
- **Constraints**: What if we only had 1 hour / zero budget / existing tools only?
- **Yes, And...**: Start with "We could..." → build 3 times with "Yes, and..."

---

## Phase 1: Clarify

### 1.1 Problem Statement
```
Problem: [What specifically needs solving?]
Context: [Background, why it matters]
Constraints: [Time, budget, tech limitations]
Success Criteria: [What does success look like?]
```

### 1.2 Starbursting (6W)
- **WHO** is affected? →
- **WHAT** exactly needs solving? →
- **WHEN** does it occur? →
- **WHERE** does it manifest? →
- **WHY** is it happening? →
- **HOW** is it currently handled? →

### 1.3 The 5 Whys
Ask "Why?" 5 times to find root cause:
1. Why? → 2. Why? → 3. Why? → 4. Why? → 5. **ROOT CAUSE**

### 1.4 Gap Analysis

| Aspect | Current | Desired | Gap | Action |
|--------|---------|---------|-----|--------|
| | | | | |

### 1.5 SWOT (Optional)

| Strengths (Internal+) | Weaknesses (Internal-) |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| | |
| **Opportunities (External+)** | **Threats (External-)** |
| | |

---

## Phase 2: Ideate (Divergent)

**Rules:** ✅ No criticism ✅ Wild ideas welcome ✅ Quantity > Quality ✅ Build on ideas ⏱️ Time-box 5-10 min each

### 2.1 Classic Brainstorm
Rapid dump - list 10+ ideas without filtering:
1. / 2. / 3. / 4. / 5. / 6. / 7. / 8. / 9. / 10. ...

### 2.2 Mind Mapping
```
[PROBLEM] ─┬─ Branch 1 ─┬─ idea 1.1
           │            └─ idea 1.2
           ├─ Branch 2 ─── idea 2.1
           └─ Branch 3 ─┬─ idea 3.1
                        └─ idea 3.2
```

### 2.3 Crazy Eights
8 ideas in 8 minutes (1 min each). No erasing. Speed > perfection.

### 2.4 SCAMPER

| | Prompt | Your idea |
|-|--------|-----------|
| **S** | Substitute - what can replace? | |
| **C** | Combine - what can merge? | |
| **A** | Adapt - borrow from other domains? | |
| **M** | Modify - magnify/minimize? | |
| **P** | Put to other uses? | |
| **E** | Eliminate - what to remove? | |
| **R** | Reverse - do opposite? | |

### 2.5 Reverse Brainstorming
How to make problem WORSE? → Then reverse each for solutions.

### 2.6 Cross-Domain Thinking
- How does **nature** solve this?
- How would **[other industry]** handle it?
- What would **Google/Apple/Amazon** do?
- What's the **10x solution** (unlimited resources)?

### 2.7 Six Thinking Hats

| Hat | Focus | Thoughts |
|-----|-------|----------|
| ⚪ White | Facts & Data | |
| ❤️ Red | Emotions & Gut | |
| ⚫ Black | Risks & Caution | |
| 💛 Yellow | Benefits & Optimism | |
| 💚 Green | Creativity & Alternatives | |
| 🔵 Blue | Process & Summary | |

### 2.8 Rolestorming
What would suggest: Junior Dev? Senior Architect? End User? Security Expert? Competitor? A child?

### 2.9 Brainwriting (6-3-5)
Write 3 ideas → pass/pause → build on them → combine/mutate best ones.

---

## Phase 3: Evaluate (Convergent)

### 3.1 Affinity Grouping
Cluster ideas into themes:
- **Theme 1**: idea A, idea B, idea C
- **Theme 2**: idea D, idea E
- **Orphans**: ideas that don't fit

### 3.2 Prioritization Matrix

|  | Easy | Hard |
|--|------|------|
| **High Value** | ⭐ DO FIRST | 📋 Plan carefully |
| **Low Value** | 📝 Fill-ins | ❌ Avoid |

### 3.3 Evaluation Scoring

| Idea | Feasibility /5 | Impact /5 | Effort /5 | Risk /5 | Total /20 |
|------|----------------|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| | | | | | |

*Feasibility: can we do it? Impact: value delivered? Effort: 5=low. Risk: 5=low.*

### 3.4 MoSCoW
- **Must Have**: critical, non-negotiable
- **Should Have**: important but not vital
- **Could Have**: nice to have
- **Won't Have**: out of scope

### 3.5 Trade-off Analysis
For top 2-3 options:
```
Option: [Name]
✅ Pros:
❌ Cons:
⚠️ Risks → 🔧 Mitigations:
```

---

## Phase 4: Visualize

Create diagrams as needed:
- **Flowchart**: decision points, user flows
- **Sequence Diagram**: interactions between components
- **Architecture Diagram**: system components & connections
- **User Journey**: touchpoints & emotions

Use Mermaid, Excalidraw, or simple boxes/arrows.

---

## Phase 5: Decide & Document

### Decision Record (ADR)
```
## Decision: [Title]
**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated
**Context:** [Situation requiring decision]
**Options:** 1. [A] 2. [B] 3. [C]
**Decision:** [Chosen option + why]
**Consequences:** [Pros, cons, trade-offs accepted]
**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Action 1
- [ ] Action 2
```

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Techniques |
|-----------|------------|
| Need many ideas fast | Classic Brainstorm, Crazy Eights |
| Stuck in conventional thinking | Reverse Brainstorming, SCAMPER, Constraints |
| Understand problem deeply | 5 Whys, Starbursting, Gap Analysis |
| Diverse perspectives | Six Hats, Rolestorming, Cross-Domain |
| Evaluate options | Prioritization Matrix, Scoring, MoSCoW |

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Brainstorming

**Useful prompts:**
- "Generate 10 unconventional solutions for [problem]"
- "Apply SCAMPER to [solution]"
- "What would [persona] suggest?"
- "What could go wrong with [idea]?"
- "Give 5 variations of [idea] with different trade-offs"

**Tips:** Use AI as partner, not decision maker. Iterate prompts. Challenge outputs. Combine with human judgment.

## Tips

**Do:** Quantity first → Defer judgment → Time-box → Document everything → Seek diverse perspectives

**Don't:** Criticize during ideation → Stop at first good idea → Skip clarify phase → Let loudest voice dominate
